# CS340 Client Server Development
Apply database systems concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases. 

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I use industry standard dictionary input and formats. My code is well commented and uses encapsulation so that the code can be used elsewhere which makes it modular. My work on the CRUD Python module taught me a lot and will come in handy when using Mongodb in the future.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
The way I approach a problem as a computer scientist is to first gather information about the problem. Once I gather the requirements, I can figure out priority levels and set a plan to solve the problem. The techniques I learned in this course are how to use a database, how to use CRUD commands, and how to create a dashboard. I see myself needing to use these techniques in future courses like Full Stack I and II.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists are kind of like new age builders. They bridge the gap between humans and computers, allowing humans to show proof of work more effectively and efficiently. Grazioso Salvare will now be able to optimize their time and simplify their tasks. They have been provided the tools to increase productivity which will make their company a lot more effective.
